## Core Features:

- Image Enhancement: Image Enhancement using AI: Enhance low-resolution satellite images using generative AI, converting them into high-resolution images with details such as roads and buildings. The tool should decide what visual cues to use in order to maximize the quality of the images.
- High-Resolution Output: 4K Image Display: Display the enhanced images in 4K resolution for optimal viewing of details.
- Side-by-Side Viewer: Image Comparison: Side-by-side comparison of the original low-resolution image and the enhanced high-resolution image.
- Interactive Navigation: Zoom and Pan: Allow users to zoom in and pan across the enhanced image to inspect specific details.
- Custom Image Upload: Image Upload: Allow users to upload their own low-resolution satellite images for enhancement.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#72BCD4) to represent clarity and satellite imagery.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clear and modern readability.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent satellite, resolution, and enhancement features.
- The layout should emphasize the image display area. Use a split-screen for the comparison feature, and use a simple control panel that does not distract from the visual task.
- Subtle fade-in animations when the enhanced image is loaded. Smooth transitions when zooming and panning.
